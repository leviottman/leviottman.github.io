    "text": "Are the Warriors the best at drafting rookies recently?\nThe Warriors have won four championships since 2015, cementing themselves as a modern-day dynasty. With being a playoff contender year after year comes low draft picks. In the last 10 drafts, the Warriors have had an average first round pick at pick 19, but have been able to develop late-round rookies into key players that have contributed to their continued success.\nEven though the Warriors have had an average draft pick of 19, the question remains; are the Warriors the best at drafting and developing rookies?\nThe first question we will answer is “Was Jonathan Kuminga the correct choice for the Warriors in the 2021 NBA Draft?” Here’s Kuminga’s stats per 36 minutes compared to similar players drafted behind him.\n\n\nCode\nKuminga_Stat_Chart &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/warriors-nba-draft/data/2021_Draft_Kuminga.csv\")\n\n\nNew names:\nRows: 3 Columns: 24\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(4): Team, Player, College, VORPdbl (20): Pick, Yrs, G, MP...7, PTS...8,\nTRB...9, AST...10, FG%, 3P%, FT%, M...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `MP` -&gt;

When a younger Warrior player I able to break into the rotation and get sizable minutes their points per game goes up and they are able to develop into a star player for the warriors.\nThe Golden State Warriors recently have been stuck between two eras of Warrior basketball: ‘The Big Three’’, and the development of their younger players. Preparing for a future without Stephen Curry and company is something the Warriors need to accomplish, but there is only 240 minutes to distrubute between 8 to 10 players a game.\n\n\nCode\nGSWstats &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/warriors-nba-draft/data/leviottmanproject.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 85 Columns: 17\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): player\ndbl (16): season, season_type, games_played, minutes_per_game, points_per_ga...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nGSWrookies &lt;- GSWstats |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% c(\"Stephen Curry\", \"Klay Thompson\", \"Jordan Poole\", \"Jonathan Kuminga\", \"Brandin Podziemski\"))\n\nGSWrookies_long &lt;- GSWrookies |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(points_per_game), names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nGSWrookies_long_firstthree &lt;- GSWrookies_long |&gt;\n   group_by(player) |&gt;\n  filter(season - min(season) &lt; 6) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\nGSWrookies_long_firstthree$player &lt;- factor(GSWrookies_long_firstthree$player,\nlevels = c(\"Stephen Curry\", \"Klay Thompson\", \"Jordan Poole\", \"Jonathan Kuminga\", \"Brandin Podziemski\"))\n\nggplot(GSWrookies_long_firstthree, aes(x = season_type, y = Value, color = player, group = player)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 10.64, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Golden State Warriors player growth through their early years in the NBA\",\n    subtitle = \"Warrior players have developed very fast into key players\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\",\n    caption = \"By: Levi Ottman  |  Source: Basketball-Reference.com\",\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Stephen Curry\" = \"#1d428a\",\n    \"Klay Thompson\" = \"#ffc72c\",\n    \"Jordan Poole\" = \"#041e42\",\n    \"Jonathan Kuminga\" = \"#be3a34\",\n    \"Brandin Podziemski\" = \"#ffa300\"\n  )) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),\n    labels = c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Stat, scales = \"free_x\") + \n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", face = \"bold\", hjust = 0, size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", hjust = 0, size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1.9),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n) + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6, y = 10.64, label = \"Points Per Game league average for all positons for the 2024-25 NBA Regular Season \", color = \"red\", linewidth = 1, hjust = 0.99, vjust = -1, size = 3)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning in annotate(\"text\", x = 6, y = 10.64, label = \"Points Per Game league\naverage for all positons for the 2024-25 NBA Regular Season \", : Ignoring\nunknown parameters: `linewidth`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it is safe to say the Warriors are one of the best when it comes to drafting players late in the NBA Draft, and developing them into the type of player they are looking for."
