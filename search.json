    "text": "Are the Warriors the best at drafting rookies recently?\nThe Warriors have won four championships since 2015, cementing themselves as a modern-day dynasty. Being a playoff contender year after year comes with low draft picks. In the last 10 drafts, the Warriors have had an average first-round pick at pick 19 but have been able to develop late-round rookies into key players who have contributed to their continued success.\nEven though the Warriors have had an average draft pick of 19, the question remains: are the Warriors the best at drafting and developing rookies?\nThe first question we will answer is, ‘Was Jonathan Kuminga the correct choice for the Warriors in the 2021 NBA Draft?’ Here’s Kuminga’s stats per 36 minutes compared to similar players drafted behind him.\n\n\nCode\nKuminga_Stat_Chart &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/warriors-nba-draft/data/2021_Draft_Kuminga.csv\")\n\n\nNew names:\nRows: 3 Columns: 24\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(4): Team, Player, College, VORPdbl (20): Pick, Yrs, G, MP...7, PTS...8,\nTRB...9, AST...10, FG%, 3P%, FT%, M...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `MP` -&gt; `MP...7`\n• `PTS` -&gt; `PTS...8`\n• `TRB` -&gt; `TRB...9`\n• `AST` -&gt; `AST...10`\n• `MP` -&gt; `MP...14`\n• `PTS` -&gt; `PTS...16`\n• `TRB` -&gt; `TRB...18`\n• `AST` -&gt; `AST...20`\n\n\nCode\nKuminga_Stat_Chart_long &lt;- Kuminga_Stat_Chart |&gt;\n   select(Player, PTSper36, TRBper36, ASTper36) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(PTSper36, TRBper36, ASTper36), names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Image = case_when(\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" ~ \"data/Warriors.png\",\n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" ~ \"data/hornets.png\",\n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" ~ \"data/nets.png\"\n    ),\n    Stat = factor(Stat, levels = c(\"PTSper36\", \"TRBper36\", \"ASTper36\")),\n    Stat = recode(Stat, \n                  \"PTSper36\" = \"Points Per 36 Minutes\", \n                  \"TRBper36\" = \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\", \n                  \"ASTper36\" = \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\"),\n    Color = case_when(\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" & Stat == \"Points Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D428A\",\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" & Stat == \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D428A\",\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" & Stat == \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D428A\", \n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" & Stat == \"Points Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#00788C\",\n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" & Stat == \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#00788C\",\n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" & Stat == \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#00788C\", \n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" & Stat == \"Points Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#C6CFD4\",\n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" & Stat == \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#C6CFD4\",\n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" & Stat == \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#C6CFD4\",\n))\n\n\nggplot(Kuminga_Stat_Chart_long, aes(x = Player, y = Value, fill = Color, image = Image)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  geom_image(\n    aes(image = Image, y = Value - 1),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 1),\n    size = 0.07\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player\", \n    y = \"Per Game\",\n    title = str_wrap(\"Jonathan Kuminga is a future superstar given enough minutes\", width = 63),\n    subtitle = str_wrap(\"More minutes for Kuminga will allow him to flourish\"),\n    caption = \"By: Levi Ottman  |  Source: Basketball-Reference.com\"\n  ) +\n theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", face = \"bold\", hjust = 0, size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", hjust = 0, size = 14),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 9, face = \"italic\"),\n) +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Stat, scales = \"fixed\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany advanced basketball statistics can be hard to understand for the common viewer; one that is easier to understand is Win Shares.

When a younger Warrior player is able to break into the rotation and get sizable minutes, their points per game go up and they are able to develop into a star player for the Warriors.\nThe Golden State Warriors recently have been stuck between two eras of Warrior basketball: ‘The Big Three,’ and the development of their younger players. Preparing for a future without Stephen Curry and company is something the Warriors need to accomplish, but there are only 240 minutes to distribute between 8 to 10 players a game.\n\n\nCode\nGSWstats &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/warriors-nba-draft/data/leviottmanproject.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 85 Columns: 17\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (1): player\ndbl (16): season, season_type, games_played, minutes_per_game, points_per_ga...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nGSWrookies &lt;- GSWstats |&gt;\n  filter(player %in% c(\"Stephen Curry\", \"Klay Thompson\", \"Jordan Poole\", \"Jonathan Kuminga\", \"Brandin Podziemski\"))\n\nGSWrookies_long &lt;- GSWrookies |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(points_per_game), names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\")\n\nGSWrookies_long_firstthree &lt;- GSWrookies_long |&gt;\n   group_by(player) |&gt;\n  filter(season - min(season) &lt; 6) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\nGSWrookies_long_firstthree$player &lt;- factor(GSWrookies_long_firstthree$player,\nlevels = c(\"Stephen Curry\", \"Klay Thompson\", \"Jordan Poole\", \"Jonathan Kuminga\", \"Brandin Podziemski\"))\n\nggplot(GSWrookies_long_firstthree, aes(x = season_type, y = Value, color = player, group = player)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 10.64, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Golden State Warriors player growth through their early years in the NBA\",\n    subtitle = \"Warrior players have developed very fast into key players\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Points Per Game\",\n    caption = \"By: Levi Ottman  |  Source: Basketball-Reference.com\",\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"Stephen Curry\" = \"#1d428a\",\n    \"Klay Thompson\" = \"#ffc72c\",\n    \"Jordan Poole\" = \"#041e42\",\n    \"Jonathan Kuminga\" = \"#be3a34\",\n    \"Brandin Podziemski\" = \"#ffa300\"\n  )) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),\n    labels = c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Stat, scales = \"free_x\") + \n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", face = \"bold\", hjust = 0, size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", hjust = 0, size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1.9),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n) + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 6, y = 10.64, label = \"Points Per Game league average for all positons for the 2024-25 NBA Regular Season \", size = 2, color = \"red\", linewidth = 1, hjust = 0.99, vjust = -1)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning in annotate(\"text\", x = 6, y = 10.64, label = \"Points Per Game league\naverage for all positons for the 2024-25 NBA Regular Season \", : Ignoring\nunknown parameters: `linewidth`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it is safe to say the Warriors are one of the best when it comes to drafting players late in the NBA Draft and developing them into the type of player they are looking for."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When you think of the term; Most Valuable Player, what comes to mind? An acceptable definition of the term “MVP” is: “An award given to the athlete who is considered the most outstanding or impactful in a season, or individual who has contributed the most to their team’s success. The three finalists for the 2024-25 NBA MVP are Nikola Jokic, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. For this article, I will be focusing on the two players who have the best case for MVP; Gilgeous-Alexander, and Jokic.\nThe case for SGA: when it comes to the MVP award, is that he has led his team to a historic season. The Oklahoma City Thunder went 68-14, which is just five games behind the most wins in an NBA season, set by the Golden State Warriors. The Thunder also had the best record in the NBA, and clinched the number one seed in the Western Conference before the month of April, and secured it with a margin of 16 games.\nSGA finished the season as the league’s leading scorer, averaging 32.7 PPG, putting up 5 rebounds per game, and 6.4 assists per game.\nThe case for Jokic: Nikola Jokic has had a season statline that has only been seen twice before. Jokic joined Russell Westbrook and Oscar Robertson on the exclusive list of NBA players to average a triple double in a season, putting up a split of 29.6/12.7/10.2.\nNikola Jokic also made NBA history this season, becoming the first player to put up a 30-point, 20-rebound, 20-assist game, finishing with 31, 21 and 22, respectively. Jokic also record a 60-point triple double this season, which marks the third time in NBA history that has occured.\nPoints + Rebounds + Assists should be considered more than solely points per game, when it comes to the most “valuable” player (to their team), as getting teammates involved in scoring, and grabbing rebounds helps your team succeed. Another stat that could be considered important is True Shooting %. “rue Shooting Percentage (TS%) in basketball is a statistic that measures how efficiently a player scores by considering all shot attempts, including field goals, three-pointers, and free throws. It is considered a more accurate measure of a player’s shooting efficiency than traditional field goal percentage alone. In simple terms, a higher TS% = a more efficient scorer.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nregularseason &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/nba-mvp-2025/data/NBA_2024_25_stats.csv\")\ntripledoubles &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/nba-mvp-2025/data/NBA_2024_25_tripledoubles.csv\")\ntopscorers &lt;- read_csv(\"/Users/leviottman/Desktop/School/Office Documents/Spring 2025/Sports Data Analysis/Major Assignment/sportsBlog/posts/nba-mvp-2025/data/NBA_top_scorers_stats.csv\")\n\nJokic &lt;- topscorers |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Nikola Jokić\")\nSGA &lt;- topscorers |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\")\nGiannis &lt;- topscorers |&gt; filter(PLAYER == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\")\n\nggplot(data = topscorers, aes(x = PRA, y = `TS%`)) +\n  geom_point(data = topscorers, aes(x = PRA, y = `TS%`), color = \"gray\", size = 2) + \n  geom_point(data = Giannis, aes(x = PRA, y = `TS%`), color =\"#00471B\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = Jokic, aes(x = PRA, y = `TS%`), color = \"#0E2240\", size = 6) +\n  geom_point(data = SGA, aes(x = PRA, y = `TS%`), color = \"#007AC1\", size = 6) +\n  geom_text(data = Jokic, aes(label = PLAYER), vjust = -1.5, size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = SGA, aes(label = PLAYER), vjust = -1.5, size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  geom_text(data = Giannis, aes(label = PLAYER), vjust = -1.5, size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  xlim(30, 54) +\n  ylim(50, 75) +\n  annotate(\"rect\",\n           fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.1, xmin = 45, xmax = Inf, ymin = 59.92, ymax = Inf) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 50, y = 71, label = \"Average True Shooting %, and \\nPoints + Rebounds + Assists in Triple Doubles \\nin the 2024-25 NBA Season\", color = \"black\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 2.67) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", face = \"bold\", hjust = 0, size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"black\", hjust = 0, size = 12),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 9, face = \"italic\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Points + Rebounds + Assists\", \n    y = \"True Shooting Percentage\",\n    title = (\"Jokic leads the pack in both production and efficiency\"),\n    subtitle = (\"This begs the question; does contributing to your team make you the Most Valuable Player?\"),\n    caption = \"By: Levi Ottman  |  Source: Statmuse.com\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the chart above shows, SGA isn’t in the “sweet spot” zone for averaging a triple double when it comes to Points + Rebounds + Assists.
