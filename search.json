    "text": "Are the Warriors the best at drafting rookies recently? The Warriors have won four championships since 2015, cementing themselves as a modern-day dynasty, with that comes low draft pick numbers. In the last 10 drafts, the warriors have had an average first round pick at pick 19, but have been able to develop late-round rookies into key players that have contributed to their continued success. I am comparing the warriors picks to other players drafted just behind them to see if they truly drafted the best guy available at the time\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nKuminga_Stat_Chart &lt;- read_csv(\"data/2021_Draft_Kuminga.csv\")\n\n\nNew names:\nRows: 3 Columns: 24\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(4): Team, Player, College, VORPdbl (20): Pick, Yrs, G, MP...7, PTS...8,\nTRB...9, AST...10, FG%, 3P%, FT%, M...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `MP` -&gt; `MP...7`\n• `PTS` -&gt; `PTS...8`\n• `TRB` -&gt; `TRB...9`\n• `AST` -&gt; `AST...10`\n• `MP` -&gt; `MP...14`\n• `PTS` -&gt; `PTS...16`\n• `TRB` -&gt; `TRB...18`\n• `AST` -&gt; `AST...20`\n\n\nCode\nKuminga_Stat_Chart_long &lt;- Kuminga_Stat_Chart |&gt;\n   select(Player, PTSper36, TRBper36, ASTper36) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(PTSper36, TRBper36, ASTper36), names_to = \"Stat\", values_to = \"Value\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Stat = factor(Stat, levels = c(\"PTSper36\", \"TRBper36\", \"ASTper36\")),\n    Stat = recode(Stat, \n                  \"PTSper36\" = \"Points Per 36 Minutes\", \n                  \"TRBper36\" = \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\", \n                  \"ASTper36\" = \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\"),\n    Color = case_when(\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" & Stat == \"Points Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D428A\",\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" & Stat == \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D428A\",\n      Player == \"Jonathan Kuminga\" & Stat == \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D428A\", \n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" & Stat == \"Points Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D1160\",\n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" & Stat == \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D1160\",\n      Player == \"James Bouknight\" & Stat == \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#1D1160\", \n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" & Stat == \"Points Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#C6CFD4\",\n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" & Stat == \"Total Rebounds Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#C6CFD4\",\n      Player == \"Ziaire Williams\" & Stat == \"Assists Per 36 Minutes\" ~ \"#C6CFD4\",\n      TRUE ~ \"grey\"  # Default color for other players\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(Kuminga_Stat_Chart_long, aes(x = Player, y = Value, fill = Color)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(\n    title = str_wrap(\"Do the Warriors have a budding superstar in Jonathan Kuminga?
